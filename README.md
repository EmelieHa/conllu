# Diachronic_Treebanks_DigPhil.ipynb
Diachronic dataset for the project's experiments. Part of the group research project Diachronic Treebanks of DigPhil.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of literary texts from different periods of Modern Swedish. The texts are grouped into 50-year intervals. In the later periods, the collections primarily contain prose fiction, while the earlier periods also include private correspondence and drama, reflecting the relative scarcity of prose literature from those times.
