# Diachronic_Treebanks_DigPhil
Diachronic dataset for the project's experiments. Part of the group research project Diachronic Treebanks of DigPhil.

## Dataset Description

The data is compiled from Svediwh Diachnoric Corpus:

Eva Pettersson and Lars Borin (2022)
Swedish Diachronic Corpus
In Darja Fišer & Andreas Witt (eds.), CLARIN. The Infrastructure for Languag\ e Resources. Berlin: deGruyter. https://degruyter.com/document\ /doi/10.1515/9783110767377-022/html


The dataset consists of literary texts from different periods of Modern Swedish. The texts are grouped into 50-year intervals. In the later periods, the collections primarily contain prose fiction, while the earlier periods also include private correspondence and drama, reflecting the relative scarcity of prose literature from those times.
